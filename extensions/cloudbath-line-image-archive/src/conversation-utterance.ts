/**
 * General shape of a short conversational turn.
 *
 * This module answers "what KIND of move is this?" — a negation, an agreement,
 * a menu pick, a reference back to something already discussed, a request for
 * progress — and nothing about what it refers to. What it refers to is the
 * arbiter's job, and what it MEANS comes from the question that happens to be
 * open (see `ConversationChoice.role`).
 *
 * That separation is why there is no phrase table here. "ไม่เปลี่ยน" is not
 * wired to the default model; it is a negation, and a negation selects whatever
 * the open question declared as its negating choice. The same detector resolves
 * "ไม่มี" against the dialogue question and "ไม่เอา" against an audio question,
 * with no new code for either.
 *
 * The markers below are therefore linguistic classes, not features. Adding a
 * feature must not add a marker; adding a WAY OF SPEAKING may.
